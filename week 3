1.	Which of the following conditions are true, if a is 13 and b is 14?
a)	a + 1 <= b     TRUE    (13+1<=14)
b)	a + 1 >= b      TRUE
c)	a + 1 != b       FALSE

2.	What is the error in this statement? 
if scoreA = scoreB= :
        print("Tie")  
score A = 10
score B = 10
if score == score B :
print ("tie")

3.Supply a condition in this if statement to test whether the user entered a Y:
userInput = input("Enter Y to quit.")
if…
y =("goodbye")
userprint = input ("enter y to quit.")
if "userinput" id Y:
print("goodbye")

4…
1.	Find the errors in the following if statements.  Make corrections.
A.if x > 0 :
       print(x)

B.if (1 + x) > x ** sqrt(2) :
         y = y + x

C.if x = 1 :
      (y += 1)

D. if grade >=100:
lettergrade = "A"
print (lettergrade)
if grade >=90:
lettergrade = "B"
print (lettergrade)
if grade >=80:
lettergrade = "C"
print (lettergrade)
if grade >=70:
lettergrade = "D"
print (lettergrade)
if grade >=60:
lettergrade = "F"
print (lettergrade)

5.Write a program that sets a password as ‘changeme’ and asks the user to enter the password and keeps asking until the correct password is entered and then says ‘Accepted’. 
The program should count how many attempts the user has taken and tell them after they have been accepted.  
Extra Challenge: 
If the user takes more than 5 attempts the program should say, ‘Access denied, please press enter to exit and contact security to reset your password’

change=str(input("please set up your password"))

x=0

password=str(input("type password here"))

if password==changeme:
    print("password accept")

    else:
        while password!=changme:
            if x<4:
                print("wromng input try one more time")
                print(x+1,"attempt")
                x+=1
                password=str(input("try one more time"))

                else:
                    print("access denied")

                    break
