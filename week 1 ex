1.	What is a code repository (often also called version control system) used for?
Version control system also known as source control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites.
Using a system of version control means that:
•	There is an audit trail’
•	You can be confident that you have the most up to date version of a document
•	You can prove which documents were ‘in force’ at a particular 

2.	 Why is it advantageous to use a code repository?
The main advantage of an institutional repository is that it is easy to work out who can help when you need something done. It’s also advantageous to use a repository for storing all of your codes and to perform backups of this repository regularly. 
Tracking history, versioning, and labelling are all there to help you manage your code even if you’re just tinkering!   https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1JW4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT41&lpg=PT41&dq=It+is+also+advantageous+to+use+a+repository+for+storing+all+of+your+code,+and&source=bl&ots=6oZfzLmlYS&sig=1_6kJbaGkj3hm8YOtQr8sEN4idw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIqKPEhOiPyAIVQ0oUCh164Q8S#v=onepage&q=It%20is%20also%20advantageous%20to%20use%20a%20repository%20for%20storing%20all%20of%20your%20code%2C%20and&f=false
 
3.	 Describe the different “layers” of Software that exist on a typical computer and explain why there are different layers of software.
Antivirus - Is a software utility designed to protect your computer or network against computer viruses?
Database - Alternatively referred to as a databank or a data store, and sometimes abbreviated as a DB, a database is a large quantity of indexed digital information.

4.	Describe what an algorithm is and explain why it is a useful “tool” to translate from a human level problem (we can think of) to a computer program.
Algorithm is a procedure or formula for solving a problem. It’s useful for calculating a function calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.


5.	Write an algorithm that describes how to make scrambled eggs, try to use control words, like IF, WHEN, UNTIL, WHILE, WAIT, AND, OR.
IF – the software needs updating
THAT – Drives todays computer 
TO – An audience 
WAIT – for the perfect timing

6. Is Idle (the Python language shell) an Interpreter or an Compiler or both? Explain your answer.
I think its boths Languages are not only interpreted or only compiled, but there is a spectrum of possibilities between interpreting and compiling. 


practical work using python 
1. ) Write a command in the Idle shell that says “Hello world” 
print ("hello")
hello
print ("my name is sebastian")
my name is sebastian
